In past years, I have been fortunate enough to have participated in some of the most competitive hackathons and other competitions. Starting my streaks with Hacktober fest to continue taking part in many others globally. Through this start, I really find myself lucky as I have ended up winning some, and now I am mentoring in the hackathon.
Participating in these hackathons not only broadened my horizons but also successfully added to my perspective.
Collaborating with international students and competing with them surely gave me an edge, and that is how I ended up winning these hackathons.
Although I always enjoy technology, growing up poor in a rural area made it difficult to have access to fine tech resources or materials. So I know the pain of fewer resources, environment which most of the poor and middle-class students are facing. As we know, the more events they participate in, the more they grow fundamentally so I have developed a private community where a student can teach and a needy can learn from exclusive discussions on technologies like AI and ML are much more.
I started showing interest in Artificial intelligence and Machine learning by working on my college project personal assistant using python, and it went very popular at my college at that time, I wrote a full-fledged blog on the process of how I managed to develop a model that listens, tells jokes, news and opens a website with a single command. Many Companions forked in my projects and proposed vital enhancements.
I immediately realized it may be possible that a lot more students would also like to contribute, but they have a lack of information and free resources.
I learned how to host a website with AWS, my next goal is to guide, support, teach free Machine learning topics and write articles that can boost specifically target underprivileged students to know their own voice and to educate themselves about Machine learning and other technology.
Your support will push me further towards my dream of providing free resources and the latest news about different technologies to the students of India. I know it's a long journey that lays ahead and I know how complex the process of transferring an uneducated to enlightened is, but I want to be there so they know that they still have a choice.
